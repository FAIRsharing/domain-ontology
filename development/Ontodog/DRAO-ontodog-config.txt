Ontodog Configuration Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://ontodog.hegroup.org/

Please note that all external ontologies are listed (each in their
own sheet) in 

DRAO-ontodog-template.xlsx

The xslx file makes use of functions, which aren't
always interpreted correctly by Ontodog. Also, Ontodog expects a simple,
single-sheet CSV. Therefore, before you upload to
Ontodog, you should export the sheet as a CSV file to remove any
functions. Each external ontology has its own CSV file in the repo 
named as

DRAO-ontodog-template-xx.csv

Where "xx" is the standard acronym for that ontology.

Ontodog adds two types of annotations to the classes you specify via the input
file: inSubset annotations and user-specific alternative terms. 
Details on this step are available in the README.md for this directory.
