# Release 0.2.3

Please see the [General README](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/README.md) for
more information on DRAO, and the [License](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
file for how you can use and re-use this ontology.

## DRAO Updates

This minor point release was created to 1) reconcile the two Data hierarchies that were a natural consequence of having both EDAM and IAO data imports, and 2) make a few small but timely modifications to the ontology relating to the redevelopment of the FAIRsharing site. All tickets relating to this release are available from the [0.2.3 Milestone](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/milestone/4).

Refactored IRIs with this release are listed in [refactoredIRIs-DRAO-0.2.3.txt](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/releases/0.2.3/refactoredIRIs-DRAO-0.2.3.txt).

## Ontology Comparison

We ran a diff between the 0.2.2 and 0.2.3 releases using [Robot diff](http://robot.obolibrary.org/diff). You can find the output of that diff in [DRAO-diff.md](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/releases/0.2.3/DRAO-diff.md). This file confirms that all of the changes listed in the [0.2.3 Milestone](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/milestone/4) have been completed correctly. However, it also shows all of the updates that have been automatically propagated from all of the >50 reference ontologies that we import. This makes the diff very large. Therefore, we also performed a diff for each ticket in this milestone (see individual tickets for details). The diff that shows only those updates from reference ontologies (versus the updates performed directly on DRAO) are available in [this ticket](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/issues/73).
