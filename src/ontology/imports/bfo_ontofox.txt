#### NOTES ON BFO IMPORT ####
##
## BFO is indirectly imported by other external ontologies used in
## the AO as well as directly through this configuration file.
## This means that duplicate annotation properties are also introduced.
## We need to solve this issue so the resulting AO looks cleaner, though
## this is not an issue which breaks things.
##
## The includeAllIntermediates setting has been enabled for this
## upper-level ontology so that the correct hierarchy can be used for
## all lower-level ontology imports into the FAIRsharing AO.
## Upper-level ontologies tend to have fewer classes, while
## the includeComputedIntermediates setting is used for other
## imports to reduce bloating of the AO.
