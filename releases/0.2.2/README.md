# Release 0.2.2

Please see the [General README](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/README.md) for
more information on DRAO, and the [License](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file
for how you can use and re-use this ontology.

## DRAO Updates

This minor point release was created to 1) add COVID-19-related terms, and 2) make a few small but timely modifications to the ontology. All tickets relating to this release are available from the [0.2.2 Milestone](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/milestone/3).

Refactored IRIs with this release are listed in [refactoredIRIs-DRAO-0.2.2.txt](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/releases/0.2.2/refactoredIRIs-DRAO-0.2.2.txt).

## Ontology Comparison

We ran a diff between the 0.2.1 and 0.2.2 releases using [Robot diff](http://robot.obolibrary.org/diff). You can find the output of that diff in [DRAO-diff.md](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/releases/0.2.2/DRAO-diff.md). This file confirms that all of the changes listed in the [0.2.2 Milestone](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/milestone/3) have been completed correctly. However, it also shows all of the updates that have been automatically propagated from all of the >50 reference ontologies that we import. This makes the diff very large. Therefore, we also performed a diff between each ticket in this milestone (not shown). With the next release, we will also try to provide a diff that separates out the updates from reference ontologies from the updates performed directly on DRAO.
