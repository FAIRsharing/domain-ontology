# Release 0.2.0

Please see the [General README](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/README.md) for
more information on DRAO, and the [License](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/blob/master/LICENSE.md) file
for how you can use and re-use this ontology.

This release resolves the issues listed in the
[DRAO 0.2.0 Milestone](https://github.com/FAIRsharing/domain-ontology/milestone/2).

Note on refactoredIRIs-DRAO-RELNUM.txt: This file contains a list of IRIs that have changed since the last release. The first column contains old IRIs, and the second contains new IRIs. Their refactoring is covered in the issues listed in the milestone above.

This release has focused on cleaning up the hierarchies to present a simpler, more integrated DRAO hierarchy as well as the removal of a small number of now-obsolete terms from external ontologies.
